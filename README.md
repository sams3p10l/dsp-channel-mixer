# dsp-channel-mixer
College project for mixing two audio input channels into 6 out channels (simulating surround audio). The end result is supposed to work on Cirrus Logic DSP. Project is written in C without Assembly optimizations in model3, which should be done.

Disclaimer: Project unfinished, models have identical output sound to the ear, but model 1 and 2 difference is 16 bits, while allowed error margin was 1 bit maximum. Error is minor and it's hiding in plain sight but I didn't manage to find it.
